This document describes the steps taken to create release of the CLIP, or CLIP-based project.

Steps for release:
0. Enter the clip/ directory.
1. Update the VERSION and RELEASE fields in the CONFIG_BUILD file.
2. $ git commit CONFIG_BUILD
3. $ git push
4. $ git tag -a "<COMMENT ABOUT TAG USUALLY REFERENCING VERSION/RELEASE/PURPOSE>"
5. $ git push --tags
6. All releases must be built from a clean checkout.  Do a clean "$ git clone".
7. It is possible that someone committed after your tag so ensure you are at
your tag by using "$ git checkout <tagname>".
8. Top level "$ make <ISO>-iso". [1]
9. Upload the release to your standard location used for hosting releases.
10. Notify the appropriate parties, e.g. the entire team, of the release.

[1] Please see "$ make help" for a complete list of targets.  Two examples:
"$ make clip-rhel6-iso" <= generate an installable ISO image.
"$ make secstate-rpm" <= generate only single RPM.
