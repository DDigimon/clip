This document describes the steps taken to create release of the CLIP, or CLIP-based project.

Steps for release:
0. Enter the clip/ directory.
1. Update the VERSION & RELEASE fields in the CONFIG_BUILD file.
3. $ git commit CONFIG_BUILD
4. $ git push
5. $ git tag -a "<COMMENT ABOUT TAG USUALLY REFERENCING VERSION/RELEASE/PURPOSE>"
6. $ git push --tags
8. All releases must be built from a clean checkout.  Do a clean "$ git clone".
9. It is possible that someone committed after your tag so ensure you are at
your tag by using "$ git checkout <tagname>".
10. Top level "$ make <ISO>-installation-iso". [1]
16. Upload the release to your standard location used for hosting releases.
17. Notify the appropriate parties, e.g. the entire team, of the release.

[1] Please see "$ make help" for a complete list of targets.  Two examples:
"$ make clip-rhel6-installation-iso" <= generate an installable ISO image.
"$ make secstate-rpm" <= generate only single RPM.
