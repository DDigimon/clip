CLIP targets several use cases.  Each use case interacts and leverages CLIP in different ways.  Please review the use cases below to see where you fall.

===================================================
1. Developer starting from scratch.

A developer starting from scratch has the opportunity to leverage all of the
features available in CLIP: 
- Remediation content (QA'd snapshots from Aqueuduct)
- Audit content (QA'd XCCDF & OVAL snapshots from SCAP Security Guide)
- Build system:
  - mock for rolling RPMs from source.
  - Pungi for rolling installation ISOs.
  - Configuration management friendly yum repos and package lists.

This type of developer will want to insert new sources into the
packages/ directory.  This source will be rolled up into RPMs, placed into yum
repositories, and can then be included and used in a kickstart ending up in
the installed system.

===================================================
2. Developer with existing custom yum repositories but needs help rolling ISOs.

This developer already has packages and yum repositories.  They want to
leverage the following features:
- Remediation content (QA'd snapshots from Aqueuduct)
- Audit content (QA'd XCCDF & OVAL snapshots from SCAP Security Guide)
- Build system:
  - Pungi for rolling installation ISOs.
  - Configuration management friendly yum repos and package lists.
 
The developer uses the CLIP build system to roll ISOs with the remediation
content, audit content, and their existing custom packages present.  This
develop will want to start with CONFIG_REPOS and CONFIG_BUILD files in the root
of the CLIP repo.  They will add an entry to CONFIG_REPOS that points to their to their custom yum repo
and will move modifying kickstarts and rolling ISOs.

===================================================
3. A developer who only wants the remediation and audit content.


This developer already has packages and yum repositories.  They can already
roll ISOs.  They only want to use these features: 
leverage the following features:
- Remediation content (QA'd snapshots from Aqueuduct)
- Audit content (QA'd XCCDF & OVAL snapshots from SCAP Security Guide)

NOTE: Tresys recommends moving to the CLIP build system.  This build system
was developed based on our experiences developing cross-domain solutions.  One
of the problems we constantly see is the lack of reproducability of builds.
This build system allows you to roll RPMs in mock eliminating build host
dependencies.  It allows you to version the packages used to roll an RPM.  It
manages yum repositories and carries patched versions of ISO generation tools
to address a number of problems in those tools.  

However, if you still want to just use the remediation and audit content you
must roll their RPMs.  You should be running "$ make scap-security-guide-rpm"
and "$ make aqueduct-rpm".  The generated RPMs will end up in repos/my-repo.
You can then copy the RPMs into your own build environment and roll ISOs.
