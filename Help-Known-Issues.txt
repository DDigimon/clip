Our journey towards perfection is still a WiP so here are the CLIP known
issues:

=============================================================================
CLIP for RHEL 6.2 Alpha Release - July 17ish, 2012:

- SELinux policy needs more work to boot in enforcing mode.  This is a blocker
  for our beta release thus the beta will include a policy that supports a
default CLIP configuration in enforcing mode.

- We have the ability to roll LiveCDs which are great for stateless solutions.
  While the system works for RHEL 5, we are having issues with dracut in RHEL
6.  I hope to have these addressed by the beta release but this is not a
blocker.

- We have not updated the oss.tresys.com/projects/clip website (aside adding
  links to the new releases).  This will be done for beta and final releases.

- Secstate is only able to audit certain sub-groups of scap-security-guide.
  OpenSCAP segfaults when attempting to audit the entire XCCDF.  The groups
with x's below are the ones which can be audited with a `secstate select -r
RHEL-6 [group-name]; secstate audit`:
[x] services
[ ] system
    [x] software
    [ ] permissions
        [ ] partitions
        [x] mounting
        [x] files
        [x] restrictions
    [x] selinux
    [ ] accounts
        [x] accounts-restricitons
        [x] accounts-pam
        [x] accounts-session
        [x] accounts-physical
        [ ] accounts-banners
    [ ] network
        [x] network_disable_unused_interfaces
        [x] network_disable_zeroconf
        [x] network_sniffer_disabled
        [x] network-kernel
        [ ] network-wireless
        [x] network-ipv6
        [x] network-iptables
        [x] network-ssl
        [x] network-uncommon
        [x] networking-ipsec
    [x] logging

- `secstate remediate` still needs to be able to work for audits, using
  `secstate remediate -x [audit-results.xml].  This issue will hopefully be
addressed by the beta release.

- scap-security-guide uses a hard coded /usr/local for the install directory.
  This needs to be shifted to use `${DESTDIR}`, which defaults to /usr/local
if no usr exists.
