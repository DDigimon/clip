LiveCD Creator has numerous issues between 0.13 and 0.14, and each vendor appears to
be carrying a unique patch set but fails to provide versions of these packages which are
compatible with each other:
* pykickstart
* livecd-tools
* syslinux

So we're going to use the patched versions that CentOS uses to roll LiveCDs. Their
repo provides patched versions of both of those tools.  Here are the commands to
get this setup (run as root):

'''
echo <<EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/centos-livecd.repo
# Name: CentOS LiveCD repository
[livecd]
name = CentOS $releasever - LiveCD
baseurl = http://www.nanotechnologies.qc.ca/propos/linux/centos-live/$basearch/live
enabled=1
protect=0
gpgkey = http://www.nanotechnologies.qc.ca/propos/linux/RPM-GPG-KEY-PGuay2010
EOF

yum install livecd-tools syslinux
'''
