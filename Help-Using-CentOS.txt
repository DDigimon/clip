If you are using CentOS here is what I recommend:

1. Mount a CentOS ISO. 
2. Copy the contents of Packages/* to a location you put in CONFIG_REPOS.
3. Repeat steps 1 & 2 for each ISO image (eg 2 for the DVD images).
4. Change into the directory you copied the packages to.
5. Run "createrepo -d ."
6. You are ready to roll your installable image.
