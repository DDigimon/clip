CLIP officially supports RHEL.  That is what we test against. CentOS 
may work but there are known issues.  For example, you will get 
misleading results from interpreting SCAP content with SecState
since the SCAP content uses a <platform> tag to bind the checks
to RHEL-only.

If you are using CentOS here is what I recommend:

1. Mount a CentOS ISO. 
2. Copy the contents of Packages/* to a location you put in CONFIG_REPOS.
3. Repeat steps 1 & 2 for each ISO image (eg 2 for the DVD images).
4. Change into the directory you copied the packages to.
5. Run "createrepo -d ."
6. You are ready to roll your installable image.

Note: CentOS archives previous releases.  Currently Tresys is testing against
RHEL 6.2 (this may have changed though).  To get a specific archived ISO from
the CentOS mirrors use their "vault" sub-domain.  Eg:
- http://vault.centos.org/6.2/isos/x86_64/
