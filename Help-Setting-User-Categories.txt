After the clip installation completes, you will want to set the SELinux
categories for toor.  This can be accomplished by running the
following commands in order:

# sudo -s
# setenforce 0
# semanage user -m -L s0 -r s0-s0:c0.c1023 toor_u
# semanage login -m -s toor_u -r s0-s0:c0.c1023 toor
# exit
# exit

After logging back in, running 'id -Z' should produce following the output:
# toor_u:staff_r:staff_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
