To generate live media only use the tools in this repo.  Do not rely on other
tools because the different versions of the tools behave differently and can
generate non-bootable or otherwise broken media.

1. Run "make iso-to-disk ISO_FILE=<isofilename> USB_DEV=<devname>"
eg: "make ISO_FILE=CLIP.iso USB_DEV=/dev/sdb"
