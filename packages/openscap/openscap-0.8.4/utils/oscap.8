.RE
.RE

.TP
.B analyse\fR [\fIoptions\fR] --results FILE definitions-file syschar-file
.RS
In this mode, the oscap tool does not perform data collection on the local system, but relies upon the input file, which may have been generated on another system. The output (OVAL Results) is printed to file specified by \fB--results\fR parameter
.TP
\fB\-\-variables FILE\fR
Provide external variables expected by OVAL Definitions.
.TP
\fB\-\-directives FILE\fR
Use OVAL Directives content to specify desired results content.
.TP
\fB\-\-skip-valid\fR
Do not validate input/output files.
.RE

.TP
.B validate-xml\fR [\fIoptions\fR] definitions-file
.RS
Validate given OVAL file against a XML schema. Every found error is printed to the standard output. Return code is 0 if validation succeeds, 1 if validation could not be performed due to some error, 2 if the OVAL document is not valid.

.TP
Available submodules:

.TP
.B \fBeval\fR [\fIoptions\fR] xccdf-file [\fIoval-definitions-files\fR]
.RS
Perform evaluation driven by XCCDF file and use OVAL as checking engine. Print result of each rule to standard output. oscap returns 0 if all rules pass. If there is an error during evaluation, the return code is 1. If there is at least one failed rule, oscap-scan finishes with return code 2.
.PP
You may specify all required OVAL Definition files as last parameters. If you don't do that, oscap tool will try to load all OVAL Definition files referenced from XCCDF automaticaly(search in the same path as XCCDF).
.PP

.RS
Select a particular profile from XCCDF document.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-results FILE\fR

.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-oval-results\fR
.RS
Generate OVAL Result file for each OVAL session used for evaluation. File with name '\fIoriginal-oval-definitions-filename\fR.result.xml' will be generated for each referenced OVAL file. This option (with conjunction with the \fB\-\-report\fR option) also enables inclusion of additional OVAL information in the XCCDF report.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-export-variables\fR
.RS
Generate OVAL Variables documents which contain external variables' values that were provided to the OVAL checking engine during evaluation. The filename format is '\fIoriginal-oval-definitions-filename\fR-\fIsession-index\fR.variables-\fIvariables-index\fR.xml'.

.TP
\fB\-\-force\fR
Force resolving XCCDF document even if it is already marked as resolved.
.RE
.TP
.B validate-xml\fR [\fIoptions\fR] xccdf-file
.RS

.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-profile PROFILE\fR
.RS
Select a particular profile from XCCDF document.
.RE
.RE
.TP
.B \fBgenerate\fR [\fIoptions\fR] <submodule> [submodule-specific-options]
.RS
Generate another document form an XCCDF file such as security guide or result report.
.TP
\fB\-\-profile ID\fR
Apply profile with given ID to the Benchmark before further processing takes place.
.TP
\fB\-\-format FMT\fR
Specify output format. This option applies only on document generators (i.e. guide, report). Avalable formats: \fIhtml\fR (default), \fIdocbook\fR.
.TP
Available submodules:
.TP
.B \fBguide\fR  [\fIoptions\fR] xccdf-file
.RS
Generate a formatted document containing a security guide from a XCCDF Benchmark. Unless the --output option is specified it will be written to the standard output. Without profile being set only groups (not rules) will be included in the output.
.TP
\fB\-\-output FILE\fR
Write the guide to this file instead of standard output.
.TP
\fB\-\-hide-profile-info\fR
Information on chosen profile (e.g. rules selected by the profile) will be excluded from the document.
.RE
.TP
.B \fBreport\fR  [\fIoptions\fR] xccdf-file
.RS
Generate a document containing results of a XCCDF Benchmark execution. Unless the --output option is specified it will be written to the standard output. ID of the TestResult element to visualise defaults to the most recent result (according to the end-time attribute).
.TP
\fB\-\-output FILE\fR
Write the report to this file instead of standard output.
.TP
\fB\-\-result-id ID\fR
ID of the XCCDF TestResult from which the report will be generated.
.TP
\fB\-\-show \fIwhat\fR
Specify what result types shall be displayed in the result report. The default is to show everything except for rules with results notselected and notapplicable. The \fIwhat\fR part is a comma-separated list of result types to display in addition to the default. If result type is prefixed by a dash '-', it will be excluded from the results. If \fIwhat\fR is prefixed by an equality sign '=', a following list specifies exactly what rule types to include in the report. Result types are: pass, fixed, notchecked, notapplicable, notselected, informational, unknown, error, fail.
.TP
\fB\-\-oval-template \fItemplate-string\fR
To use the ability to include additional information from OVAL in xccdf result file, a template which will be used to obtain OVAL result file names has to be specified. The template can be either a filename or a string containing wildcard character (percent sign '%'). Wildcard will be replaced by the original OVAL definition file name as referenced from the XCCDF file. This way it is possible to obtain OVAL information even from XCCDF documents referencing several OVAL files. To use this option with results from an XCCDF evaluation, specify \fI%.result.xml\fR as a OVAL file name template.
.RE
.TP
.B \fBfix\fR  [\fIoptions\fR] xccdf-file
.RS
Generate a script that shall bring the system to a state of compliance with given XCCDF Benchmark.
.TP
\fB\-\-output FILE\fR
Write the report to this file instead of standard output.
.TP
\fB\-\-result-id \fIID\fR\fR
With this option the script generating engine will pick rules that failed for given test and generate fixes only for them.
.TP
\fB\-\-template \fIID|FILE\fR\fR
Template to be used to generate the script. If it contains a dot '.' it is interpreted as a location of a file with the template definition. Otherwise it identifies a template from standard set which currently includes: \fIbash\fR (default if no --template switch present). Brief explanation of the process of writing your own templates is in the XSL file \fIxsl/fix.xsl\fR in the openscap data directory. You can also take a look at the default template \fIxsl/fixtpl-bash.xml\fR.
