Here is a quick list of the things you need to do to get started.

1. Your build host most be able to pull packages from RHEL, Opt, and EPEL yum repos.  The details of doing this are discussed in detail elsewhere but here is a list of packages you will need to install:
- rpm-build
- mock
- createrepo
- repoview
- livecd-tools

Note: you may have to install other packages as well.  We don't know what you
installation base contains ;)

2. Modify CONFIG_REPOS to point to your *local* RHEL, Opt, and EPEL repos.

3. Add your user to /etc/sudoers (required since mock and livecd creator use
chroots)

4. Roll a Pungi RPM to install on the build host by running "make pungi-rpm".

5. Install the generated pungi rpm "# yum localinstall repos/my-repo/pungi*.noarch.rpm".

6. CHANGE THE DEFAULT PASSWORD IN YOUR KICKSTART!  CLIP intentionally ships with an unencrypted
default password!  It is "neutronbass".  DO NOT LEAVE THIS PASSWORD LINE
INTACT!

7. Go back and re-read #6.

8. Roll an ISO by running "$ make clip-rhel6-installation-iso".
Note: for a complete list of targets available please run "$ make help".

After you have successfully rolled an installation ISO it is time to move on
to customizing the image.  Each topic related to customizing the image is
discussed in Help-*.txt files in the root of the CLIP repo.
