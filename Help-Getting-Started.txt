Here is a quick list of the things you need to do to get started.

1. If you're using RHEL you need to subscribe you system to the "Optional"
software channel (if you're using CentOS for your build host you can ignore
this step):
"sudo rhn-channel --add --channel=rhel-x86_64-server-optional-6.2.z"

2. Install the necessary packages via yum:
"sudo yum install rpm-build mock createrepo repoview" 

3. Modify CONFIG_REPOS to point to your *local* RHEL, Opt, or CentOS repos.  
Refer to Help-FAQ.txt for help setting up local yum repos.

4. Add your user to /etc/sudoers (required since mock and livecd creator use
chroots)

5. Add your user to the "mock" group.

6. Roll a Pungi RPM to install on the build host by running "make pungi-rpm".

7. Install the generated pungi rpm by running "# yum localinstall repos/my-repo/pungi*.noarch.rpm".

8. CHANGE THE DEFAULT PASSWORD IN YOUR KICKSTART!  CLIP intentionally ships with an unencrypted
default password!  It is "neutronbass".  DO NOT LEAVE THIS PASSWORD LINE INTACT!

9. Go back and re-read #7.

10. Roll an ISO by running "$ make clip-rhel6-iso".
Note: for a complete list of targets available please run "$ make help".

After you have successfully rolled an installation ISO it is time to move on
to customizing the image.  Each topic related to customizing the image is
discussed in Help-*.txt files in the root of the CLIP repo.
